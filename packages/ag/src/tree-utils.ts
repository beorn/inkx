 * Find the deepest virtual-text descendant whose `inlineRects` contain the point.
 *
 * Virtual text nodes (a `<Text>` nested inside another `<Text>`) have no layout
 * node and no `scrollRect`, so the rect-based tree walk can't reach them —
 * `inlineRects`, computed during text rendering, is their only geometry. They
 * nest arbitrarily (`<Strong>` wrapping a `<Link>`), and collection flattens
 * every level's span into the parent's `childSpans`, so every level gets rects.
 * The walk must therefore recurse: stopping at the outermost matching run
 * returns the styling wrapper, and the interactive descendant inside it never
 * becomes an event target even though its region was computed correctly.
 *
 * Raw text leaves carry rects too, but they're content rather than elements
 * (no handlers, no props of interest), so they're never a deeper answer than
 * the element that owns them — mirroring `elementFromPoint`, which returns an
 * element and never a text node. A raw leaf is still returned when it's the
 * only match, which keeps the hit target for plain `<Text>` content unchanged.
