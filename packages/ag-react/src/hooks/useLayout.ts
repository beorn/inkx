/**
 * Layout Hooks — three coordinate systems for positioning in silvery.
 *
 * Every silvery node has three rects that differ only by how scroll and
 * sticky offsets are applied. Pick the one that matches your use case:
 *
 * - `useBoxRectDangerously()` — layout position (border-box sized, minus
 *                       padding/border). Use for responsive sizing inside a
 *                       component. Matches CSS `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`
 *                       for the content area.
 * - `useScrollRect()` — scroll-adjusted position, **pre** sticky clamping.
 *                       Use when you need the "natural" position of a node
 *                       in scrolled coordinates (can go off-screen).
 * - `useScreenRect()` — actual paint position on the terminal screen.
 *                       Use for hit testing, cursor positioning, and
 *                       cross-component visual navigation. The CSS
 *                       `getBoundingClientRect()` analogue.
 *
 * ## Deferred semantics (the only contract)
 *
 * Each hook returns the rect as of the **most recent committed layout** —
 * the value as of the last event-batch commit boundary. Within a single
 * batch, the returned value is invariant across every convergence pass;
 * React renders see one value per batch. After the batch's commit boundary
 * fires, the next batch sees the new value.
 *
 * This is the structural fix for the "render reads useBoxRectDangerously AND
 * writes a layout-affecting prop based on it" feedback loop. Under the in-flight
 * model that preceded this hook (pre 2026-05-06), the read returned the
 * latest measurement during the same batch, which could differ between
 * the first and second convergence passes — causing the write to flip
 * between branches and the loop to ping-pong until `MAX_CONVERGENCE_PASSES`
 * capped it. Under deferred semantics the read is invariant for the
 * batch, so the loop completes in one pass.
 *
 * **One-frame-late by design.** A component that mounts shows the
 * empty-rect fallback (`{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0 }`) on its
 * first render and the real rect on the next commit boundary. Layout
 * effects that run on the second render see the real rect and can write
 * positioned terminal escapes (Image, decorations) into the next
 * paintFrame.
 *
 * Components that need same-frame measurements must read `node.boxRect`
 * etc. directly via `useAgNode()` and gate on `useLayoutEffect` —
 * recommended only for leaf primitives in the silvery framework itself.
 *
 * For breakpoint logic, prefer `useResponsiveValue()` or
 * `useResponsiveBoxProps()` — bucketing into stable zones gives more
 * predictable behavior than branching on raw widths.
 *
 * See bead `@km/silvery/use-deferred-box-rect-and-post-commit-observers`.
