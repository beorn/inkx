 * Trusts the plan: no marker re-collection, no scrim/default resolution,
 * no amount validation, no capability re-derivation (`plan.kittyEnabled`
 * is the sole source of truth for the emoji branch).
 *
 * Wide ≠ emoji. CJK / Hangul / Japanese fullwidth text occupies two columns
 * but responds to `fg` color normally — it goes through the standard mix
 * path. Only EMOJI (bitmap glyphs that ignore `fg`) need special handling,
 * detected via `isLikelyEmoji(cell.char)`.
 *
 * For emoji cells, two paths, mutually exclusive:
 *
 * 1. **Kitty graphics available** (`plan.kittyEnabled === true`): emoji cells
 *    are SKIPPED entirely here. `./realize-kitty.ts` emits a translucent
 *    scrim image at alpha=amount above each emoji cell, and the terminal
 *    composites the overlay on top of the unmixed cell, landing at
 *    `cell_bg * (1 - amount) + scrim * amount` — the same luminance as
 *    surrounding text cells. This avoids the double-fade that would make
 *    emoji bg visibly blacker.
 *
 * 2. **Kitty graphics unavailable** (`plan.kittyEnabled === false`): the
 *    per-cell mix runs on emoji cells too and stamps `attrs.dim` (SGR 2)
 *    on lead + continuation. Terminals honoring SGR 2 on emoji fade the
 *    glyph; others see the glyph at full brightness but the cell bg
 *    matches surroundings.
 *

 * Derive ONE scene-level polarity target for the legacy (scrim===null) path by
 * sampling the faded region's resolvable cell backgrounds.
 *
 * ### Why scene-level, not per-cell
 *
 * The legacy path runs when no theme bg flows into the backdrop options, so
 * there is no single `defaultBg` to derive a scrim from. The previous fix
 * (@km 19665) darkened each cell toward a PER-CELL polarity target. That
 * correctly darkened the dark status bar, but it also sent every LIGHT element
 * (a light scrollbar block, a light-on-dark badge) toward WHITE — making those
 * cells BRIGHTER under the modal instead of receding. On a dark scene a light
 * element must recede toward the DARK scene; on a light scene a dark element
 * must recede toward the LIGHT scene. Polarity is a property of the SCENE, not
 * of the individual cell — so we resolve it once for the whole region.
 *
 * ### Sampling approach: dominant-by-count of polarity buckets
 *
 * We walk every cell in the region (`forEachBackdropCell` — the same walker
 * the realize pass uses, so the sampled set is exactly the faded set) and
 * tally resolvable backgrounds into two buckets: `dark` (luminance below the
 * surface midpoint) and `light` (at/above it). The dominant bucket wins:
 *
 *   - light > dark  → `LIGHT_SCRIM` (predominantly-light scene)
 *   - otherwise     → `DARK_SCRIM`  (predominantly-dark scene; ties → dark)
 *
 * Counting buckets (rather than averaging luminance) is deliberately
 * outlier-resistant: it matches a median's robustness for a BINARY polarity
 * decision without storing/sorting a per-cell sample array each frame. A scene
 * that is 95% dark cells with a handful of bright accents stays "dark" no
 * matter how extreme those accents are — a mean could be dragged across the
 * midpoint by a few saturated cells. Ties resolve to `DARK_SCRIM`, the
 * historical dark-theme default (a tie on a TUI is overwhelmingly a dark scene
 * with light accents).
 *
 * ### Fallback
 *
 * Returns `null` when the region has NO resolvable bg cells (every cell is
 * null / DEFAULT_BG). With no sample there is nothing to count, so the caller
 * falls back to the per-cell `legacyScrimTargetFor` heuristic.
 *
 * Cheap: one extra walk of the region, two integer counters, no allocation
 * beyond the walker's own visited bitset.

 *
 *   fg' = deemphasizeOklchToward(fg, amount, scrimTowardLight)
 *   bg' = mixSrgb(bg, scrim, amount)
 *
 * Fg uses OKLCH deemphasize (not sRGB mixing) so colored text deemphasizes
 * perceptually — pale lavender becomes dull slate on dark themes, pale
 * grey on light themes. The polarity flag `scrimTowardLight` (from the
 * plan) steers L toward 0 or 1; chroma falloff is symmetric. Bg uses sRGB
 * source-over because the Kitty graphics scrim overlay composites in sRGB
 * at alpha at the hardware level.
 *
 * `null`/`DEFAULT_BG` cells are resolved to `plan.defaultBg` first (that
 * IS the color the terminal paints), then mixed toward the scrim — so
 * empty cells darken at the same rate as explicitly-colored cells.
 *
 * Uniform amounts for fg + bg preserve relative brightness ordering across
 * borders vs fills. Heaviness is controlled by `plan.amount` (default
 * 0.25, calibrated against macOS 0.20, Material 3 0.32, iOS 0.40, Flutter
 * 0.54).
 *
 * The `scrim !== null` gate activates the full two-channel path: fg always
 * deemphasizes (OKLCH), and bg mixes toward the scrim when a resolvable bg
 * hex is available (`cell.bg` non-null OR `defaultBg` non-null).
 *
 * When `scrim === null` (no theme context resolved a default bg) the LEGACY
 * path runs. It is ALSO two-channel, but derives a SCENE-LEVEL polarity target
 * (`regionTarget`, sampled once over the whole region in `realizeToBuffer`)
 * instead of a single theme scrim:
 *
 *   fg' = mixSrgb(fg, cell.bg, amount)         // fg recedes toward its own bg
 *   bg' = mixSrgb(bg, regionTarget, amount)    // regionTarget = DARK_SCRIM for
 *                                              // a predominantly-dark scene,
 *                                              // LIGHT_SCRIM for a
 *                                              // predominantly-light one
 *
 * Using ONE scene-level target (not the cell's own luminance) is the @km 19684
 * fix: a per-cell target made light elements (a light scrollbar block) recede
 * toward WHITE even on a dark scene — brightening them under the modal instead
 * of dimming. When the region had no resolvable bg sample
 * (`regionTarget === null`), this cell falls back to the per-cell
 * `legacyScrimTargetFor` heuristic.
 *
 * Recede-ing the bg here is what makes opaque background blocks (a status bar
 * with an explicit hex bg, a colored panel) recede under the backdrop even
 * with NO node-theme prop mounted — otherwise they stay full-brightness and
 * "pop" outside the modal overlay. Cells whose bg is unresolvable (null /
 * DEFAULT_BG) have nothing to mix toward, so they fall back to a dim stamp.
 *
 * ### Wide-char / emoji handling
 *
 * Terminals render emoji using the glyph's own bitmap colors — the fg mix
 * has no visible effect on the emoji glyph. Two paths, mutually exclusive:
 *
 * 1. Kitty graphics available: `fadeCell` SKIPS emoji wide cells entirely.
 *    The Kitty overlay composites the scrim at alpha=amount on top, landing
 *    at `cell * (1 - amount) + scrim * amount` — same as surrounding cells.
 * 2. Kitty unavailable: mix the cell bg + stamp `attrs.dim` on lead +
 *    continuation. Terminals honoring SGR 2 on emoji fade the glyph. Wide
 *    TEXT (CJK etc.) goes through the normal deemphasize path on both
 *    branches — the fg mix works fine and SGR 2 on CJK over-fades.
