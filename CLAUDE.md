# km - Task Management TUI

TypeScript, Bun, Ink (React TUI), SQLite. Bidirectional sync: TUI ↔ Model ↔ Markdown files.

## Commands

```bash
bun run test:fast    # Fast tests (~11s) - iterate here
bun run test:all     # Full tests - before commit
bun fix              # Lint + format - must pass
bun km view <path>   # Run TUI
```

**Never** use bare `bun test`. See [.claude/skills/tests/] for TDD workflow and test types.

**Use bun, not npm:** `bun add` (not `npm install`), `bunx` (not `npx`), `bun run test:all` (not `npm test`).

## Architecture

Layered: App → Board → Tree → Storage → Parser → Filesystem. Each layer calls only layer below.
UI never touches filesystem; all edits bidirectional. See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Vendor Packages (Git Submodules)

Packages in `vendor/` (inkx, chalkx, mdtest, flexx, etc.) are **git submodules** that are part of km.
When you find bugs in these packages, fix them directly - do not work around them. Each vendor
package has its own CLAUDE.md with API documentation. See [.claude/skills/git/commit.md] for
committing changes to submodules.

## Code Style

ESM only; type inference; important code first; fail fast; factory functions not classes.
See [docs/principles.md](docs/principles.md).

## Issue Tracking

Use `/pm` for beads (issues/tasks/features). Always claim before starting: `bd work <id>`.
See [.claude/skills/pm/] for commands and common mistakes.

## Commits

Use `/git commit`. Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org): `type(scope): message`

## Session Completion

Before ending: `bun fix && bun run test:all && git push`. Propose next steps with AskUserQuestion.
